# Database Design Primer

Having a very good understanding about database design fundamental concepts is very important for all working on software development as well as data engineering fields. No mater which tech stack we use to build the application or to implement a datawarehouse or even a PowerBI Data model for analysis, knowing how OLTP datases should be designed is a very important skill. Therefore, I thought of sharing some of the things I know with you. 

I am using a Postgres Dataase for the training to show all the SQL Demos. But, anyone can use which ever database they prefer for this. There will be some queries which are specific to Postgres. Therefore, if you are not familiar with SQL then use a postgres db for the labs. 

## **PostgreSQL Database Design Curriculum**

Here the topics, I have structured then into, three-levels. It is designed to take a team from the foundational concepts to some advanced concepts through hands-on, practical examples. After following this training, there will be some database design scenario questions, which you all can go through to further solidify your knowlede. Below is how the topics are structured.

## **Level 1: The Foundations (Beginner)**

This level introduces the core building blocks of relational databases, focusing on fundamental concepts and basic SQL commands.

- **Module 1: What is a Database?** üìö
  - Learn the basics of databases, tables, rows, columns, and schemas. This module is the starting point for anyone new to databases.

- **Module 2: Relational Concepts** ü§ù
  - Understand how to connect data across multiple tables using **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys** to form one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

- **Module 3: Normalization** ‚ú®
  - Dive into the principles of **normalization** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF). Learn how to structure data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, using a practical, step-by-step approach.

## **Level 2: Building Robust Schemas (Intermediate)**

Building on the foundations, this level focuses on creating schemas that are not just functional but also reliable, secure, and performant.

- **Module 4: Data Types** üìù
  - Explore various PostgreSQL data types, including `TEXT`, `JSONB`, and `ARRAY`, and learn how to select the right type for your data to ensure efficiency and accuracy.

- **Module 5: Constraints & Integrity** üîí
  - Master the use of constraints like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK` to enforce business rules and prevent invalid data from entering the database.

- **Module 6: Indexing & Performance** ‚ö°
  - Learn how to use **indexes** to drastically improve query performance on large datasets. The module demonstrates this with the `EXPLAIN` command, showing the before-and-after impact of an index.

---

## **Level 3: Advanced Concepts & Practice (Advanced)**

This final level covers complex, real-world scenarios and advanced PostgreSQL features used in professional development.

- **Module 7: Advanced Data Modeling** üß©
  - Discover powerful features like **Table Inheritance** for creating specialized tables and **Materialized Views** for pre-calculating and storing complex query results, optimizing performance for reporting and analytics.

- **Module 8: The Art of Denormalization** üìà
  - Understand the trade-offs of **denormalization**‚Äîintentionally introducing redundancy to boost the performance of read-heavy applications, making a small number of `SELECT` queries much faster.

- **Module 9: Real-World Case Study** üöÄ
  - Apply all learned concepts to design a complete, multi-table schema for a fictional project management application. This capstone module ties everything together, demonstrating how to build a robust and well-designed database from scratch.
